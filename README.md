# Moment of Reflection

You're gonna need V8 version 4.9 or higher, so I recommend downloading one of
the [Node nightlies][nightlies] and putting it in here in a `node-6/`
directory, and then linking like `ln -s ./node-6/bin/node node`. That's what I
did.

Then simply run the code with `./node <file.js>`
